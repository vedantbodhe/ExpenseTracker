# ExpenseTracker
I made an app to track my expenses in accordance with my budget. The app is coded fully in Python with Tkinter GUI and Matplotlib,csv exports. Enjoy!

# Libraries required
Type in: "pip install matplotlib" in your terminal/command prompt if not already installed. (type it without including the " ")
